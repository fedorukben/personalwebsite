			About Me
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			Hello! I'm Benjamin, a computer science student, studying at University of Ontario Institute of
			Technology in Oshawa, ON. I consistently practice strong problem solving skills, and am able to
			discover unique solutions to problems, on my own. I am able to organize work for ease of accessibility
			and readability. I know how to effectively collaborate with others of varying backgrounds while 
			working on a team -- I am truly a strong leader and listener. I have proven to, and will continue to strive to make positive experiences in all my work.

			Philosophy Statement
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			I believe strongly in advocating for youth, whose voices are often underrepresented. I try my hardest
			to think deeply about all subjects, and to try to come up with solutions to any problems I encounter. 
			In fact, I am basing my whole academic discipline around finding the best and most fundamental solutions 
			to the problems of the world, using logical means. I try to combine as many sciences as I can together, 
			especially the fields of mathematics, computer science, physics, and philosophy, into the realm of logic. 
			I strongly believe that my research will create a better, more well-understood tomorrow.
