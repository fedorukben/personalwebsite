            STEM Fellowship Event Coordinator

        	I started working as the Program Management Team Lead at STEM Fellowship in August of 2021. I worked extensively to organize the "behind-the-scenes" attributes of the 2021-2022 High School Big Data Challenge (HSBDC). In January of 2022, I began a new position at STEM Fellowship -- Event Coordinator. In this new position, I am overseeing future Inter-University and High School Big Data Challenges. As of writing, I am working on both the 2022 Inter-University Big Data Challenge (IUBDC), and am working on a novel competition.
