            2021 Undergraduate Big Data Challenge
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            Through June and July of 2021, I participated with a team of researchers to use big data to help prevent the spread of misinformation online. During the COVID-19 pandemic,
            the World Health Organization (WHO) defined the rampant spread of misinformation occuring, specifically relating to COVID-19, an "infodemic". The field of infodemiology was
            quickly spawned, as the study of the prevention of infodemics. Through my leadership, my team wrote a manuscript on July 4th 2021 discussing a novel algorithm suggested for
            the reduction and control of the spread of misinformation on social media platforms. We named this algorithm the Plebeian Algorithm. On July 17th 2021, the team was invited
            to participate in the Undergraduate Big Data Challenge's Big Data Day event, where we were judged for a 30-minute defense period. My team won the most prestigious award of
            the challenge, the JMIR Infodemic Innovation Award, sponsored by JMIR Publications. I am truly humbled to have been awarded this honour. My team is continuing to develop the
            idea through incubation, and are in the publication process in JMIR Infodemiology.
