					Hello! I'm Benjamin, a computer science student, studying at University of Ontario Institute of Technology in Oshawa, ON. I am also an interdisciplinary academic researcher, seeking any research opportunities. I consistently practice strong problem solving skills, and am able to discover unique solutions to problems, on my own. I am able to organize work for ease of accessibility and readability. I know how to effectively collaborate with others of varying backgrounds while working on a team -- I am truly a strong leader and listener. I have proven to, and will continue to strive to make positive experiences in all my work.

					My growing history demonstrates the work ethic I possess. This work ethic is highly apparent through my academic endeavours. I also have experience in work environments relating to data science. Most of my non-academic experience has been voluntary, thus exemplifying my various passions.

			Philosophy Statement
		</div>
		<div class="phil-statement">
			I believe strongly in advocating for youth, whose voices are often underrepresented. I try my hardest to think deeply about all subjects, and to try to come up with solutions to any problems I encounter. In fact, I am basing my whole academic discipline around finding the best and most fundamental solutions to the problems of the world, using logical means. I try to combine as many sciences as I can together, especially the fields of mathematics, computer science, and philosophy, into the realm of logic. I strongly believe that my research will create a better, more well-understood tomorrow.
