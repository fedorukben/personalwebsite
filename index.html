				<div class="section">
					Hello! I'm Benjamin, a mathematics student, studying at University of Ontario Institute of Technology in Oshawa, ON. I am also an interdisciplinary academic researcher, seeking any research opportunities. I consistently practice strong problem solving skills, and am able to discover unique solutions to problems, on my own. I am able to organize work for ease of accessibility and readability. I know how to effectively collaborate with others of varying backgrounds while working on a team -- I am truly a strong leader and listener. I have proven to, and will continue to strive to make positive experiences in all my work.

				Research Interests
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				I am interested in noticing patterns in everyday life. I find pure mathematics to be highly pattern-based, and strongly believe that applying a similar problem-solving approach and abstract mindset will solve real world problems. I have a passion for algebra and number theory. I also have interdisciplinary research experience in infodemiology.

				Podcast

			<div class="grid-home-alt">
				<div class="section">
					In my first year of undergraduate studies, I began an academic podcast -- the Benjamin D. Fedoruk Podcast. I wanted to excite a future generation of researchers, giving them advice and offering conversations with career researchers. I enjoy speaking to individuals who are not only researching computer science or mathematics, but am open to interdisciplinary discussions. I hope that this podcast provides inspirational and thought-provoking content.

			Philosophy Statement
		</div>
		<div class="phil-statement">
			I believe strongly in advocating for youth, whose voices are often underrepresented. I try my hardest to think deeply about all subjects, and to try to come up with solutions to any problems I encounter. In fact, I am basing my whole academic discipline around finding the best and most fundamental solutions to the problems of the world, using logical means. I try to combine as many sciences as I can together, especially the fields of mathematics, computer science, and philosophy, into the realm of logic. I strongly believe that my research will create a better, more well-understood tomorrow.
