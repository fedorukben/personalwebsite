        <div class="section">
            Although I've spent most of my time acting in voluntary capacities, I have worked in several paid positions.
            My first paid position was at Recreation World RV, in the summer of 2019. In this position, I acted as an office
            assistant, working on filing paperwork, entering hand-written data into online databases, and re-creating/simplifying
            a Microsoft Excel file using VBA.<br><br>
            My other employment was with Best Buy Canada, where I worked as a Computing Sales Advisor. In this position, I worked
            as a computer salesperson, selling tablets, laptops, desktops, and various other accessories. I learnt to work closely
            with a team of individuals, to help others when I was needed, and to ask for help when I was struggling. This was
            due to the fast-paced environment during my time of employment, going through Black Friday and the Christmas season of
            2020.
