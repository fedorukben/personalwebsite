            I have truly excelled in my educational experiences. I attended Sir Winston Churchill Collegiate and Vocational Institute for my former two years of secondary school. After the school's closure, I moved to Superior Collegiate and Vocational Institute. I received International Baccalaureate Diploma Certificates in Higher-Level English and Standard-Level Mathematics, receiving a 5 in each subject. I graduated from Superior Collegiate and Vocational Institute, through the International Baccalaureate Programme in June 2020. I also received my Ontario Secondary School Diploma, in supplement to my International Baccalaureate certificates. I was deemed an Ontario Scholar by the Ministry of Education, in November 2020.

            I am currently attending the University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT, or under the pseudonym Ontario Tech University). I am studying for my Bachelor's in Integrated Mathematics and Computer Science. I hope to do work in a Co-op setting through UOIT. My expected graduation should occur at the end of the academic year of 2024, however I hope to extend my studies and take the Science and Management program, extending my study by an additional academic year. This program would teach me the business and managerial aspects of mathematics and computer science.
