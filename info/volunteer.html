            I possess an extensive record for community involvement throughout my volunteer career. I have worked most extensively with the Regional Multicultural Youth Council (RMYC), from 2017 to 2019. I began my journey as a simple member of the RMYC, but quickly, my leadership potential was noticed, and I began to take on a stronger role within the council. My first official position was as the Vice President of Communications, where I ensured that all members of the council were informed of upcoming events; I started this position in spring of 2018. By the autumn of 2018, I was appointed as the Vice President of the council. I took on an active leadership role in the group, helping members to achieve their projects.

            In 2019, I was invited to help create a forum in my hometown, Thunder Bay, for Anishinaabeg youth to address concerns regarding their educational system. The discussion, named Voices of Youth: 2019, was instrumental in my personal development. It taught me to work cohesively with individuals of different backgrounds. By extension, I learnt to formulate an idea based on input by a vast array of varying perspectives. The conference was hosted by Pathways to Education, with support from 3 Things Consulting. One lesson that I take from this experience, is that it is extremely difficult to anticipate the reaction by a community. I had to realize that, perhaps what we wanted to offer the Indigenous community, was not what they needed.

            In August of 2020, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, I started an educational youth organization in Thunder Bay, ON, called discover(CS). I have been serving as the President of the organization since its incorporation in June of 2021. In this position, one of the very interesting skills I've learnt is the ability to be adaptive in spite of challenges. My organization faced challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but I was able to adapt to the changes as they occurred.

            In August of 2021, I started work in the role of Program Management Team Lead with STEM Fellowship. I am excited to be learning how to be a good manager of a team working on the National Big Data Challenge initiative. This is a new experience for me, and I cannot wait to see the impact I will have on young STEM enthusiasts.
