            I possess an extensive record for community involvement throughout my volunteer career. I have worked most extensively with the Regional Multicultural Youth Council (RMYC), from 2017 to 2019. I began my journey as a simple member of the RMYC, but quickly, my leadership potential was noticed, and I began to take on a stronger role within the council. My first official position was as the Vice President of Communications, where I ensured that all members of the council were informed of upcoming events; I started this position in spring of 2018. By the autumn of 2018, I was appointed as the Vice President of the council. I took on an active leadership role in the group, helping members to achieve their projects.

            In 2019, I was invited to help create a forum in my hometown, Thunder Bay, for Anishinaabeg youth to address concerns regarding their educational system. The discussion, named Voices of Youth: 2019, was instrumental in my personal development. It taught me to work cohesively with individuals of different backgrounds. By extension, I learnt to formulate an idea based on input by a vast array of varying perspectives. The conference was hosted by Pathways to Education, with support from 3 Things Consulting. One lesson that I take from this experience, is that it is extremely difficult to anticipate the reaction by a community. I had to realize that, perhaps what we wanted to offer the Indigenous community, was not what they needed.

            In August of 2020, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, I started an educational youth organization in Thunder Bay, ON, called discover(CS). I have been serving as the President of the organization since its incorporation in June of 2021.
