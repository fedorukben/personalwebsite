            Dr. Andrew Muncaster<br>
            In this course, students will engage in analyses of scientific and technological developments from the perspective of broad social impacts. Special attention will be paid to controversial issues currently receiving media attention, but the major emphasis will be on ways of thinking critically about both the remediation of already existing problems (e.g. toxic substance clean-up) and the prevention of future problems (e.g. environmental impact analyses and or economic impact analyses). Canadian examples will be of primary concern, but students will also learn to think about impact globally since large-scale problems do not respect political boundaries.
