            The Benjamin D. Fedoruk Podcast is currently in the early stages of production. It will be released on various podcast platforms.
            It will take the form of interviews, where academics explain what makes them excited about their field, at a level which is understandable
            to students, and those without any academic experience. If you or someone you know is an academic, and is interested in having a conversation, 
            please reach out to me at <a href="mailto:ben@benfedoruk.com">ben@benfedoruk.com</a>. Episodes will appear below as they are released.

			    7. Studying Supports for People with Disabilities<br>
		    </b>
		    In this episode of the Benjamin D. Fedoruk Podcast, I was so excited to get to catch up with a friend from high school -- Jaimi Plater. This episode centered around some of the political science-based research which Jaimi has been conducting as of late, pertaining to optimal ways to help those with disabilities. She discusses a more social scientific style of research, which constrasts well with my typical scientific style. I think this episode will prove useful for anyone interested in conducting studies which directly impact human beings, and the policies which they live under.

			    6. The Black Box of Publishing<br>
		    </b>
            In this episode of the Benjamin D. Fedoruk Podcast, I was thrilled to get the opportunity to speak with Joe Pold. This was a very unique episode, trying to uncover some of the mysticism and ambiguity which new researchers are faced with when beginning their journey in the publication of their work. As any researcher would recognize, after a new researcher has completed their first manuscript, they have only completed half of the battle. They have a whole new journey ahead of them -- publication.

			    5. Bettering Lives Using Stem Cells<br>
		    </b>
		    In this episode of the Benjamin D. Fedoruk Podcast, I was thrilled to get the opportunity to speak today with Parmin Sedigh. This was an incredibly interesting conversation with a highschool student who has done extensive research in the field of stem cells. As is apparent in our discussion, my knowledge of stem cells is extremely lacking. I most certainly learned quite a bit from Parmin.<br>

                4. Manganese Dioxide<br>
            </b>
            In this episode of the Benjamin D. Fedoruk Podcast, I welcomed another past TA, who is currently finishing up her undergraduate journey at Ontario Tech University: Naida Tania. Naida has done much research in computer science, but our discussion focused more on the journey she took to get to where she is today, as a successful undergraduate researcher. We discussed her first paper, published in her high school in Singapore: Manganese Dioxide Based Supercapacitors.<br>

            </b>
            In this episode of the Benjamin D. Fedoruk Podcast, I welcomed past TA and soon-to-be professor of mine, Michael Lombardo. Michael has done extensive research in the field of computer vision throughout his undergraduate and graduate careers. He has done specific applications into video analysis and genomics. Michael and I dive deep into the field of computer vision, but ensure that the information is presented in an approachable way. We discuss research strategies along the way.<br>

            </b>
            In this episode of the Benjamin D. Fedoruk Podcast, I welcomed a mentor of mine, Anish R. Verma. Anish has worked extensively in the field of quantum mechanics, and specifically its applications in the financial world. Anish and I chat about a few of his recent papers, and discuss the quantum world in an approachable manner. <br>

                1. Moderating Social Media Democratically<br>
            </b>
            In this episode of the Benjamin D. Fedoruk Podcast, I was happy to welcome Kai Fucile Ladouceur and Russell Frost as guests. We discussed a paper which the three of us (and another researcher, Harrison Nelson) wrote, titled <em>The Plebeian Algorithm: A Democratic Approach to Censorship and Misinformation.</em> In this episode, we dive deep into the research process, including aspects of truth, and the process for coming up with a good solution to a complex problem.
