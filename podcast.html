            The Benjamin D. Fedoruk Podcast is currently in the early stages of production. It will be released on various podcast platforms.
            It will take the form of interviews, where academics explain what makes them excited about their field, at a level which is understandable
            to students, and those without any academic experience. If you or someone you know is an academic, and is interested in having a conversation, 
            please reach out to me at <a href="mailto:ben@benfedoruk.com">ben@benfedoruk.com</a>. Episodes will appear below as they are released.

			7. Studying Supports for People with Disabilities<br>
		</b>
		In this episode of the Benjamin D. Fedoruk Podcast, I was so excited to get to catch up with a 
		friend from high school -- Jaimi Plater. This episode centered around some of the political 
		science-based research which Jaimi has been conducting as of late, pertaining to optimal ways
		to help those with disabilities. She discusses a more social scientific style of research, 
		which constrasts well with my typical scientific style. I think this episode will prove useful
		for anyone interested in conducting studies which directly impact human beings, and the policies
		which they live under.

			6. The Black Box of Publishing<br>
		</b>
		In this episode of the Benjamin D. Fedoruk Podcast, I was thrilled to get the opportunity to
		speak with Joe Pold. This was a very unique episode, trying to uncover some of the mysticism 
		and ambiguity which new researchers are faced with when beginning their journey in the
		publication of their work. As any researcher would recognize, after a new researcher has 
		completed their first manuscript, they've only completed half of the battle. They've got a
		whole new journey ahead of them -- publication. 
		<b>
			5. Bettering Lives Using Stem Cells<br>
		</b>
		In this episode of the Benjamin D. Fedoruk Podcast, I was thrilled to get the opportunity to 
		speak today with Parmin Sedigh. This was an incredibly interesting conversation with a high
		school student who has done extensive research in the field of stem cells. As is apparent
		in our discussion, my knowledge of stem cells is extremely lacking. I most certainly learned 
		quite a bit from Parmin.<br>

                4. Manganese Dioxide<br>
            </b>
            In this episode of the Benjamin D. Fedoruk Podcast, I welcomed another past TA, who is currently
            finishing up her undergraduate journey at Ontario Tech University: Naida Tania. Naida has done
            much research in computer science, but our discussion focused more on the journey she took to get
            to where she is today, as a successful undergraduate researcher. We discussed her first paper, published
            in her high school in Singapore: Manganese Dioxide Based Supercapacitors.<br>

                3. Let There Be Sight<br>
            </b>
            In this episode of the Benjamin D. Fedoruk Podcast, I welcomed past TA and soon-to-be professor
            of mine, Michael Lombardo. Michael has done extensive research in the field of computer vision
            throughout his undergraduate and graduate careers. He has done specific applications into video 
            analysis and genomics. Michael and I dive deep into the field of computer vision, but ensure
            that the information is presented in an approachable way. We discuss research strategies along
            the way.<br>

                2. Impacts of the Quantum World<br>
            </b>
            In this episode of the Benjamin D. Fedoruk Podcast, I welcomed a mentor of mine, Anish R.
            Verma. Anish has worked extensively in the field of quantum mechanics, and specifically its
            applications in the financial world. Anish and I chat about a few of his recent papers, and 
            discuss the quantum world in an approachable manner. <br>

                1. Moderating Social Media Democratically<br>
            </b>
            In this episode of the Benjamin D. Fedoruk Podcast, I was happy to welcome Kai Fucile Ladouceur and Russell Frost as guests. We discussed
            a paper which the three of us (and another researcher, Harrison Nelson) wrote, titled 'The Plebeian Algorithm: A Democratic Approach to Censorship
            and Misinformation.' In this episode, we dive deep into the research process, including aspects of truth, and the process for coming up
            with a good solution to a complex problem. <br>
