            The Benjamin D. Fedoruk Podcast is currently in the early stages of production. It will be released on various podcast platforms.
            It will take the form of interviews, where academics explain what makes them excited about their field, at a level which is understandable
            to students, and those without any academic experience. If you or someone you know is an academic, and is interested in having a conversation, 
            please reach out to me at ben@benfedoruk.com. Episodes will show up below as they are released.

                3. Let There Be Sight<br>
            </b>
            In this episode of the Benjamin D. Fedoruk Podcast, I welcomed past TA and soon-to-be professor
            of mine, Michael Lombardo. Michael has done extensive research in the field of computer vision
            throughout his undergraduate and graduate careers. He has done specific applications into video 
            analysis and genomics. Michael and I dive deep into the field of computer vision, but ensure
            that the information is presented in an approachable way. We discuss research strategies along
            the way.<br>

                2. Impacts of the Quantum World<br>
            </b>
            In this episode of the Benjamin D. Fedoruk Podcast, I welcomed a mentor of mine, Anish R.
            Verma. Anish has worked extensively in the field of quantum mechanics, and specifically its
            applications in the financial world. Anish and I chat about a few of his recent papers, and 
            discuss the quantum world in an approachable manner. <br>

                1. Moderating Social Media Democratically<br>
            </b>
            In this episode of the Benjamin D. Fedoruk Podcast, I was happy to welcome Kai Fucile Ladouceur and Russell Frost as guests. We discussed
            a paper which the three of us (and another researcher, Harrison Nelson) wrote, titled 'The Plebeian Algorithm: A Democratic Approach to Censorship
            and Misinformation.' In this episode, we dive deep into the research process, including aspects of truth, and the process for coming up
            with a good solution to a complex problem. <br>
