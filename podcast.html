            The Benjamin D. Fedoruk Podcast is currently in the early stages of production. It will be released on various podcast platforms.
            It will take the form of interviews, where academics explain what makes them excited about their field, at a level which is understandable
            to students, and those without any academic experience. If you or someone you know is an academic, and is interested in having a conversation, 
            please reach out to me at ben@benfedoruk.com. Episodes will show up below as they are released.

            1. Moderating Social Media Democratically<br>
            In this episode of the Benjamin D. Fedoruk Podcast, I was happy to welcome Kai Fucile Ladouceur and Russell Frost as guests. We discussed
            a paper which the three of us (and another researcher, Harrison Nelson) wrote, titled 'The Plebeian Algorithm: A Democratic Approach to Censorship
            and Misinformation.' In this episode, we dive deep into the research process, including aspects of truth, and the process for coming up
            with a good solution to a complex problem. <br>
