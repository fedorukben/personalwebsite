            GM/OVIN Accessible Mobility Challenge

            Throughout January 2022, I worked on a team from the <u><a href='https://www.nsii.ca'>Northern Shores Innovation Institute</a></u> to create the SenseHB Network, a proposed assistive technology for people with sensory processing disorder, allowing them to utilize air travel with ease and comfort. This solution was created as a part of the Accessible Mobility: Towards a Zero-Barrier Mobility Challenge, hosted by OVIN and General Motors. On February 9th, the team did a live pitch to a panel of judges, as a member of the finalists for the competition. The judges placed us third, out of numerous submissions from across Ontario. I am grateful to have received this amazing opportunity, and am proud to support individuals with SPD, including myself, to better utilize air travel.
