            In 2018, I was nominated to receive the Step Up Hero Award. This award recognized me for my volunteerism in my
            community, specifically for my role as the Vice President of the Regional Multicultural Youth Council (in Thunder
            Bay, ON). The award was sponsored by Dilico Anishinabek Family Care and the Children's Aid Society of the District
            of Thunder Bay. I fondly look back on the inspirational speech which Manitoba New Democrat Leader (and Leader of
            the Opposition) Wab Kinew delivered.
