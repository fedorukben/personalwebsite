            Across Peru, rural areas and the areas surrounding major cities, known as pueblos jovenes, are impoverished and lack access to appropriate healthcare. Past healthcare initiatives have focused on delivering care in major urban centres where the bulk of Peruvian Health is centred. Addressing the systemic healthcare needs of these impoverished Peruvians and the acute need for medical care requires a solution capable of education, resource supply and patient transport. Edu-Act Peru is a scalable modular system designed to integrate smoothly into the existing social structure and medical infrastructure of Peru. Composed of HealthBeacons, small autonomous stations for educating Peruvians and calling support, and HealthDecks, autonomous offroad vehicles capable of transporting supplies of all types to pueblos jovenes and transporting patients to clinics, the system addresses all needs of the ongoing health crisis. When integrated with software to facilitate communication between the two components and to include doctors, research indicates the system could be viable in addressing the healthcare needs of underserved Peruvians at a low cost and high efficiency. Through the integration of physicians with autonomous technology, the initiative aims to expand the reach of healthcare in developing countries around the world and provide a framework for a permanent solution to be implemented.<br>
